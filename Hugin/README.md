## Hugin: monitoring tool

**Hugin** is a built-in service providing monitoring and simple analytics for Pantheon.

Analytics page can be found at `[forseti_url]/stats`, though, only account with superadmin privileges will have access to it.

Hugin does not collect any private information, and all the analytics are de-personalized. This makes Hugin GDPR-compliant and allowed to be used in EU.

### Legend

**Hugin** is one of two crows of Odin, watching for everything happening across the worlds. See wikipedia for details :)
